# SQL Analysis Portfolio Project: European Soccer Database

This repository contains a collection of SQL queries and analyses performed on a comprehensive European soccer database. The project's main goal is to showcase my ability to solve complex business problems and derive insights using advanced SQL skills.

## üìà Project Objective

The primary objective of this project is to analyze the performance of various teams and leagues across Europe using several key metrics. The core analytical questions explored include:

-   Identifying entities that meet (or do not meet) specific complex criteria using `EXISTS` and `NOT EXISTS`.
-   Creating overall performance rankings for all teams or leagues using the `RANK()` window function.
-   Generating independent, isolated rankings for each league or team using `PARTITION BY`.
-   Analyzing a team's match-over-match form by accessing data from previous rows using the `LAG()` window function.

## üóÇÔ∏è Datasets Used

The analysis was performed using four primary CSV files, located in the `/data` folder:

* **`country.csv`:** Contains ID and name for each country.
* **`league.csv`:** Contains ID, country ID, and name for each league.
* **`team.csv`:** Contains ID and name for each team.
* **`match.csv`:** Contains detailed match-level data, including season, date, teams, and scores.

## üõ†Ô∏è Skills Demonstrated

Throughout these exercises, the following SQL competencies were applied:

* **Advanced Querying:**
    * Correlated Subqueries
    * `EXISTS` & `NOT EXISTS` Operators
* **Window Functions:**
    * Advanced ranking with `RANK()` & `DENSE_RANK()`
    * Accessing previous row data with `LAG()`
    * Dynamic windowing with `OVER(PARTITION BY ... ORDER BY ...)`
* **Table Joins & Manipulation:**
    * `JOIN` (including multiple joins to the same table)
    * Calculated fields and functions like `ABS()`
* **Core SQL Commands:**
    * `SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`

## üìÇ SQL Script Descriptions

Each `.sql` file in the `/sql_scripts` folder answers a specific analytical question:

* **`01_Highest_Scoring_Home_Match_Per_Team.sql`:** Finds the highest-scoring home match for every single team in the dataset.
* **`02_Teams_Scoring_Over_10_Goals.sql`:** Uses `EXISTS` to identify teams that have scored 10 or more goals in a single match.
* **`03_Teams_With_No_Away_Wins.sql`:** Uses `NOT EXISTS` to list all teams that have never won an away game.
* **`04_Leagues_Without_A_0_0_Draw.sql`:** Finds all leagues that have never had a 0-0 draw.
* **`05_Rank_Matches_By_Goal_Difference.sql`:** Ranks matches in a single season based on the absolute goal difference.
* **`06_Rank_Matches_Within_Each_League.sql`:** Uses `PARTITION BY` to rank the highest-scoring matches independently for each league.
* **`07_Rank_Each_Teams_Best_Home_Performance.sql`:** Ranks the best home-game performances for each team individually.
* **`08_Rank_Team_Away_Performance_By_Season.sql`:** Partitions by both team and season to analyze and rank a team's performance year-over-year.
* **`09_Analyze_Team_Form_With_LAG.sql`:** Uses the `LAG()` function to analyze a team's form by comparing goals scored in the current match to their previous one.
